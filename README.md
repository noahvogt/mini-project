# mini-project
a suckless email client for android

## Purpose
What is the specific purpose of this application? And what does *«suckless»* even mean?

While a lot of the «Open Source» Projects pride themselves in having a lot of features and many lines of code, we do not like this approach to software. More complex software is more prone to bugs (which brings security risks with it), is harder to maintain and less extensible.

To solve these issues, this software project aims at providing a simple base application - with what we consider absolutely essential features - while other non-essential, optional features can be easily installed using *a built-in plugin manager*.

## State of Development
We do not have fully implemented all essential features right now, so this program *is considered not yet usable*. As of now, release v1.0 is planned for late July 2021.

Also, *mini-project* is just the current codename, because we do not have had an idea for a good name until now.

## Licensing
