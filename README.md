a suckless email client for android

Note: This is *school project*

## Purpose
What is the specific purpose of this application? And what does *«suckless»* even mean?

While a lot of the «Open Source» Projects pride themselves in having a lot of features and many lines of code, we do not like this approach to software. More complex software is more prone to bugs (which brings security risks with it), is harder to maintain and less extensible. For further reading, check out the [suckless philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy).

To solve these issues, this software project aims at providing a simple base application - with what we consider absolutely essential features - while other non-essential, optional features can be easily installed using *a built-in plugin manager*.

## State of Development
We do have implemented most essential features right now, but not all of them, so this program *is considered not yet fully usable*. Because this is a school project, release v1.0 will be the state of the program when it is turned in. Further development and future releases to finish this project however are planned none the less.

## Licensing
